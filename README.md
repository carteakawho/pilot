Python Data Visualization for Storytellers
Why?
For frustrated and reluctant matplotlib users who care about crafting good data visuals. Matplotlib can be a blank canvas, offering more room for customization than you might find in Microsoft Excel, and offers the advantages of reproducibility and automation that come from working with Python. Still, becoming comfortable with matplotlib requires a lot of patience.
